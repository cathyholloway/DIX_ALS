It progresses at different rates for different people, and unfortunately, it remains fatal. People living with ALS/MND are often motivated to raise awareness of the debilitating nature of the condition whilst simultaneously wanting people to understand that just because they now speak differently or move differently, they are the same person they were before ALS/MND developed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/course":{"id":"introduction/course","title":"What is this course?","description":"The disability interaction module follows the curriculum laid out in the Disability Interactions: Creating Inclusive Innovations book. The course takes the disability interaction (DIX) approach and framework and applies it to the challenges faced by people living with ALS/MND. Whilst students can pursue individual projects which don\'t have ALS/MND. Most choose to build upon the co-design sessions with people living with ALS/MND for their projects. These can be concepts for new technologies or testing how people find and use current technologies.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/dix":{"id":"introduction/dix","title":"What is DIX?","description":"DIX looks at two levels of interaction, the one between a disabled person and technology, and the outcome of these interactions \u2013 the daily activities which make up a person\'s life which are aided by technology.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/language":{"id":"introduction/language","title":"A note on language","description":"ALS/MND","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"welcome":{"id":"welcome","title":"Welcome","description":"The aim of this webiste is to document the lesssons during the 2022/23 Disability Interaction module which is taught at UCL as part of the MSc Disability Design & Innvoation and MSc Human-Computer Interaction programmes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
