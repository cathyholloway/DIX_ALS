## Crazy 8's
### Method type
Ideation
### Description
This ideation method challenges team members to draw 8 different ideas in 8 minutes on an A4 piece of paper folded into 8 squares. Team members then share each idea in turn. This method works best when ideating around specific problem statements or 'how might we's?' to provide focus. Crazy 8's is an excellent way to energise a team's creativity around a problem space and to explore many ideas in a short space of time. 
### Adapting for ALS/MND
plwMND may not be able to use their hands to write or draw - you will need to adapt the exercise to ensure they can participate. Perhaps a team member can work directly with them to discuss their ideas and draw on their behalf.
Eight minutes may not be long enough if a plwMND has a communication or accessibility need. Adapt the exercise to fit their needs.
### Output
8 sketched ideas per team member, per problem statement.
### Time and resources required
8 minutes to sketch, 5 minutes (max) per team for show and tell. 3-5 people. Paper and pens/pencils.
### Difficulty
Easy
