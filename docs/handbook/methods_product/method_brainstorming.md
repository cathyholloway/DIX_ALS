## Brainstorming
### Method type
Ideation
### Description
A group activity where people record ideas or thoughts relating to the topic/ problem which you brainstorm. Members of the group should try to contribute with spontaneity, actively writing their contributions on post-it notes and sticking them to a wall or on a mind-map that everyone contributes to. Brainstorms stimulate group creativity by getting people to actively and freely contribute all their ideas. 
### Adapting for ALS/MND
Ensure that all the participants' physical and communication needs are understood and considered.
Equality of access is essential - plwMND may have very different needs depending on where they are in their disease progression.
Someone that still has speech is likely to say a lot more than someone that uses a device to communicate. You must ensure that all feel they can equally participate. Let us know if you need help.
### Output
A large amount of collated solutions or knowledge which are ready to be refined.
### Time and resources required
30-60 minutes. 3-5 people. Pen, paper, post-its, or digital equivalent.
