## Worst Idea
### Method type
Ideation
### Description
This ideation method makes you think about the worst solutions and product features in response to specific problem starting points. By designing the worst product you can imagine, you now have a clear version of what you must avoid creating. Creating the 'best' ideas, solutions, and product features will now be easier. 
### Adapting for ALS/MND
Ensure that all the participants' physical and communication needs are understood and considered.
Equality of access is essential - plwMND may have very different needs depending on where they are in their disease progression.
Someone that still has speech is likely to say a lot more than someone that uses a device to communicate. You must ensure that all feel they can equally participate. Let us know if you need help.
plwMND may not be able to use their hands to write or draw - you will need to adapt the exercise to ensure they can participate. Perhaps a team member can work directly with them to discuss their ideas and draw on their behalf.
### Output
A terrible idea that you can now work to avoid creating. You might even stumble on a great idea!
### Time and resources required
30 minutes. 1-3 team members. Pens and paper.
### Difficulty
Easy
