## 11*
### Method type
Ideation
### Description
When developing your products and services using this method, you imagine what features or services you'd have to offer to merit a standard 1-5* rating. You then take it to the extreme by imagining what your product would have to do to merit a 6-11* rating. This method can help inject creativity into your team's thinking by forcing you to think beyond the status quo. Using current technology, the 11* version of your product is probably unrealistic or impossible. However, how close can you get with the resources and technologies you have at a price point that can support a sustainable business model? 
### Adapting for ALS/MND
Ensure that all the participants' physical and communication needs are understood and considered.
Equality of access is essential - plwMND may have very different needs depending on where they are in their disease progression.
Someone that still has speech is likely to say a lot more than someone that uses a device to communicate. You must ensure that all feel they can equally participate. Let us know if you need help.
plwMND may not be able to use their hands to write or draw - you will need to adapt the exercise to ensure they can participate. Perhaps a team member can work directly with them to discuss their ideas and draw on their behalf.
### Output
A list of product features that can be mixed and matched depending on what rating you want your product to have and what you can realistically create.
### Time and resources required
60-minutes. 2-5 people.
### Difficulty
Easy
