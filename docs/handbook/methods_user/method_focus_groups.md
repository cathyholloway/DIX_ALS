## Focus Groups
### Method type
Research
### Description
Focus groups are a meeting where carefully selected users or stakeholders participate in a moderator-guided discussion about topics of interest to the moderator. Focus groups are a great way to get sophisticated insights into how many people view or experience an issue. Additionally, participants will often remind each other of particular experiences or provide contrasting views.
### Adapting for ALS/MND
Ensure that all the participants' physical and communication needs are understood and considered.
Equality of access is essential - plwMND may have very different needs depending on where they are in the disease progression.
Someone that still has speech is likely to say a lot more than someone that uses a device to communicate. You must ensure that all feel they can equally participate. Let us know if you need help.
### Output
Bullet point summaries, refined insights and problem statements are standard. Fully transcribed and formally analysed theme maps are the most rigorous output. How you will use the evidence, time frame, and team experience will be vital in deciding how rigorous you should and can be when creating outputs.
### Time and resources required
Focus groups typically last 45-60 minutes. A focus group guide covering topics to discuss is often needed. Participants must be recruited (see #user development #recruitment) and likely rewarded for their time.
### Difficulty
Hard
### Additional Considerations
The moderation requires practice, and coordination can be challenging.
