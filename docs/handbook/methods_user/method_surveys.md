## Surveys
### Description
Surveys are a collection of questions that are asked to a group of people to find out about their experiences, preferences and likely their annoyances when interacting with something or experiencing something. Usually, surveys are submitted online and completed remotely. Therefore, many people (potential users or actual users) can be surveyed quickly. The insights generated from data can provide excellent starting points for more in-depth research or product design.
### Adapting for ALS/MND
Many plwMND won't have movement in their hands and may find it difficult to use a keyboard. Check with the plwMND what the easiest way to complete a survey would be for them. They may ask their carer to help or use assistive technology like an eye-gaze device. 
Adapt your survey to meet their accessibility needs.
