## Semi-structured interviews
### Method type
Research
### Description
Semi-structured interviews are one-to-one meetings between you and your target users (or relevant stakeholders). You should ask questions following an interview guide; however, you are free to explore other issues naturally occurring during the interview. Interviews are an excellent way to immerse yourself in a problem space and to get a rich lived experience of a problem. They can also help validate issues, produce starting points for ideation, or validate solutions. 
### Adapting for ALS/MND
If the plwMND has difficulty talking or is using a device to communicate - plan for the interview to take much longer than you expect. You may need to visit multiple times - because plwMND get tired quickly.
You may consider letting the plwMND have advanced sight of the questions you plan to ask - it will help them prepare an answer if they have to type it on a device.
Consider the most important questions - you may have limited time.
### Output
Bullet point summaries, refined insights and problem statements are standard. Fully transcribed and formally analysed theme maps are the most rigorous output. How you will use the evidence, time frame, and team experience will be vital in deciding how rigorous you should and can be when creating outputs.
### Time and resources required
Interviews typically last 30-60 minutes. An interview guide covering topics to discuss is needed. Interviewees must be recruited and likely rewarded for their time.
### Difficulty
Medium
