## Expert User Interviews
### Description
Expert user interviews are one-to-one interviews with a target user with a deeper than usual understanding of their disability. Examples may be disabled individuals who have set up a charity for people with the same or similar disabilities. Expert users may also have created assistive technologies themselves, using their unique lived experience to guide product development. Expert users can use their lived experience to interpret problems experienced by other individuals. Therefore, they understand the problem space and help you understand it as well. Sometimes, however, insights can also be biased to the expert user's experiences.
