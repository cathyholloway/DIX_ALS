## The Five Whys
### Method type
Research
### Description
Using this method, you start by asking 'why' a specific action, event or user interaction happened. Then you ask 'why' the answer occurred. Repeat this 5-times to reach a root cause. 5 whys help you understand the root cause of why events or user behaviour occur. If you reach a convincing root cause, you now have a starting point for solution development. If you cannot reach a root cause, you now have a starting point to conduct more research to improve your understanding of the problem space. 
### Adapting for ALS/MND
This is a powerful tool for exploring attitudes plwMND may encounter in life. For example: Why do people think I am drunk when my words are slurred? And it could lead to interesting ideas around education and empowerment.
Be careful not to turn this method into a discussion around why someone got MND - unless they particularly want to. Many won't, as it is very sensitive.
### Output
A clear understanding of what the 'real' underlying motivation or problem is driving events or user behaviour.Â 
### Time and resources required
30 minutes, 2-4 people, post-it-notes/ flipcharts; or digital equivalent.
### Design stage maturity
All stages. 
### Difficulty
Easy
