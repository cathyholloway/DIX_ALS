## Expert Clinical Interviews
### Method type
Research
### Description
Expert clinical interviews are one-to-one meetings between you and a clinician working in your product/ problem space. Expert clinicians already know your target users. As part of their job, they need to know the typical problems faced by your target user, the pathway to accessing clinical care, and what solutions exist. Therefore, they can help you understand the ecosystem your product needs to exist within, how your product can help users, and how it may be accessed. However, clinicians may have different priorities compared to your target users, so they cannot be used instead of direct user interviews.
### Adapting for ALS/MND
Clinicians do not have MND, but they are very busy people. Some clinicians that have offered to help us are based in the USA, so you need to ensure to meet at a time that suits them. 
Clinicians have met many hundreds of plwMND and can give you great insight into what may be helpful for your project.
Be prepared - they really don't have much time. 
### Output
Comprehensive insights into the general trends that affect your target users from a clinical perspective.
### Time and resources required
Interviews typically last 30-60 minutes. Access to clinicians.
### Difficulty
Medium to hard
