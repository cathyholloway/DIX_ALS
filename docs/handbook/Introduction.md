We first quickly take an overview of how to design with people wiht ALS/MND and then you can explore specific methods. We have taken methods from the (GDI Hub Innovator's Toolkit) [https://www.disabilityinnovation.com/toolkit] and addapted them for ALS/MND design work. They are divided into methods for working with technology users and methods for developing solutions
## How to work with people living with MND/ALS (plwMND) when using any method you choose to use.
1. plwMND are unwell and living with a terminal disease. They frequently get tired, although they may not tell you when they are. Always check to see if they are ok and always offer to stop. You can pick it up another time. Let them decide. Don't plan for long sessions (more than an hour).
2. plwMND are busy. They often have many visits or appointments daily - carers, nurses, and visits to the hospital. You will need to be flexible and cause the minimum stress for them. They live in a different situation, and we must adapt ours.
3. plwMND almost always want to help other plwMND. This is why they have agreed to work with you. If you are on the module to make a positive difference in the world - let them know. 
4. plwMND are people. They have a story to tell. They have jobs, careers, wishes, families, loves and losses. Always work with them as people, and spend time understanding who they are. MND is just one part.
5. No one asked to have MND, and almost no one knows why they got it. The people you work with are going through a very difficult time. Be sensitive at all times. If they get upset, offer to meet another time. If they decide they don't want to continue - that's completely ok - just let us know, and we will help you.  
6. plwMND eventually lose movement in their body and become unable to speak. This means they may need to use a device to communicate with you, which may take much longer than expected. Check the best way to communicate with them - their carer may help to let you know. Whatever 
is easiest for the plwMND you should use. Adapt your approach to fit them. If you need help - let us know.
7. plwMND may not be able to use their hands to write or draw - you will need to adapt the exercise to ensure they can participate. Perhaps a team member can work directly with them to discuss their ideas and draw on their behalf.
8. If you don't understand what a plwMND has said to you, say you don't understand and repeat back the parts that you do. NEVER just act like you understand when you don't - it is disrespectful, and they will probably know anyway. If you need help - let us know.
9. Enjoy this - few people get the opportunity to work directly with plwMND - you can do something special and help where it matters.
