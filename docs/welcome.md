The aim of this webiste is to document the lesssons during the 2022/23 Disability Interaction module which is taught at UCL as part of the MSc Disability Design & Innvoation and MSc Human-Computer Interaction programmes.

All of the content will have been written by the tutors, the students, the participants with ALS/MND and the people who supported the delivery of the module. These people conisist of industry leaders, cares of people wiht ALS/MND and clinicians.

We hope the resource can be helpful for people living with ALS and MND - as you will be able to find possible solutions to challenges you are facing. 

We also hope the resource will be helpful to people who want to design technologies which support people living their best lives when they have ALS/MND.
