# A note on language
## ALS/MND
According to the International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations: "**Motor Neurone Disease** (MND) is the name given to a group of diseases in which the nerve cells (neurones) that control 
muscles undergo degeneration and die. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis** (ALS), **Progressive Muscular Atrophy** (PMA), **Progressive Bulbar Palsy** (PBP) and **Primary Lateral Sclerosis** (PLS) are all subtypes of motor neurone disease.
MND is the widely used generic term in the United Kingdom, Australia and parts of Europe, and ALS is used more generically in the United States, Canada and South America." (ALS/MND Aliiance)[https://www.als-mnd.org/]
Therefore, we use ALS/MND to describe the broad spectrum of conditions covered by Motor Neurone Disease.

## Disabled Person V's Person with Disability
Language is important, especially regarding how we describe disadvantaged groups. The language surrounding disability is no different. How we describe people with disabilities is highly contested and political.
**Person-first language** – i.e. person with a disability – acknowledges that a person is first, it comes ahead of the disability. It ensures populations and people within them do not become after the description of a part of them.
**Identity-first language** – i.e. disabled person – pus a person's identity as a disabled person first. It is not something the person is separate from. Their disability is an integral part of who they are. It also reclaims power.
Person-first language is commonly supported in the United Nations and geographies such as North America. Identity-first language is supported in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Within these geographies, people and groups may feel strongly for one type of language or another. Within this Handbook, both are used, as the author wishes, as we respect both viewpoints.
