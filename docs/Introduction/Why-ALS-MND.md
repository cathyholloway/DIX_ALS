# Why do we focus on ALS/MND?
ALS/MND is a complex condition affecting many aspects of life and bodily functions. It progresses at different rates for different people, and unfortunately, it remains fatal. People living with ALS/MND are often motivated to raise awareness of the debilitating nature of the condition whilst simultaneously wanting people to understand that just because they now speak differently or move differently, they are the same person they were before ALS/MND developed. The condition makes designing for and with people with ALS/MND challenging, but the attitude of people living with ALS/MND makes this process wonderfully enjoyable and rewarding. Since introducing it as a topic within the course, we have found a renewed energy for creating with people living with ALS/MND, which helps push the boundaries of the possible for us all.
At GDI Hub, we are also incredibly lucky to have Richard Cave in our team, who has a lifetime of experience of working with people with speech and language difficulties. He introduced us to the International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations. We have developed a rich relationship with the Alliance and, with their support and Richards's many networks,  now deliver this module.
