# What is DIX?

**DIX looks at two levels of interaction**, the one between a disabled person and technology, and the outcome of these interactions – the daily activities which make up a person's life which are aided by technology.

It was first published as a [manifesto](pathname:https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10074473/3/Holloway_Disability%20interaction%20(DIX).%20A%20manifesto_AAM.pdf) and later developed into a [book](pathname:https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-03759-7).

The Disability Interaction (DIX) approach has six principles:
    1. Disability inclusion is a wicked problem.
    2. There is a need to use an Applied and Basic research Combined (ABC) approach to tackle the design of technology for disabled people.
    3. Co-creation across a wide range of stakeholders is essential for the success of technological solutions for disabled people.
    4. Technology advances offer the opportunity for radically different interactions, which we look to harness.
    5. To ensure technology is adopted, we must measure the value and usefulness of the technology to disabled people and to society more broadly.
    6. Adopting an open and scalable mentality can help technologies reach more people more quickly.

These high-level principles which are operationalised through a framework which has four dimensions:
    1. Complexity and uncertainty – how will we develop technologies which can adapt to increased levels of complexity and uncertainty, which can be due to a person's conditions and fluctuating abilities and the environments in which these occur? 
    2. Wellbeing – how will the technology enhance a person's wellbeing, connections and human flourishing?
    3. Power & Participation  – how much agency is being given to disabled people and their communities within any technology project?
    4. Innovation – to have the idea is insufficient, as is an invention. It is only when people adopt the invention that it has the opportunity to change their lives.

**The aim of this Handbook is to apply the DIX principles and framework to the problems facing people living with ALS/MND**. In doing this, we predict a refinement of the framework.
